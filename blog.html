            <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2021</h2>
            <p>Marketing is a key organization function that is more proximate to revenue generation through company-customer exchanges than other functions. 
            To help executives understand how marketing generates revenue, and how to develop a methodical  approach to making marketing decisions,
             this programme is structured around the theme of ‘Market Orientation’, one of the most important marketing strategy learnings in the past three decades. 
             “Market orientation has been defined as the organizational culture that most effectively and efficiently creates the necessary behavior for the creation of superior customer value for buyers and thus,
              continuous superior performance for the business” (Narver and Slater 1990).
               A robust and large body of research and practice has found that among the various company orientations observed in the marketplace, market orientation is the path to greatest (a) innovation, (b) customer satisfaction,
                (c) employee satisfaction, (d) firm value, (e) customer loyalty, and (f) long-term profitability and sustainability.</p>
